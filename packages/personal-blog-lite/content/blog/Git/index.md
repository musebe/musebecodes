# **Introduction**

To many beginners getting into software development, tooling can be a very difficult process to understand. You tend to get confused when you get to hear someone mention “GIT” and at the same time “GITHUB”.Well not anymore!!!
I am going to try as much as possible to explain to you the difference between the two terminologies and their applications in the software development lifecycle.

This guide aims to give you a grasp and understanding of the basic terminologies and commands you’ll frequently use in your day to day activities as a software developer.

## **What is version control?**

I will start by explaining the bombastic word _“version control”_ which will lead us to a better understanding of the role played by git.

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

## **What is Git?**

I came to learn of git some years back when I was working on a client’s project using an old laptop that was termed a moving desktop by my friends due to its inability to save power (Faulty battery). Upon electricity going off, I lost all the work I had done as I had not had enough time to save my work. Imagine losing two days of work, in my case “Lines of code”. Painful, right ??

Since desperate situations need desperate measures, I did my research and came across an awesome tool that has completely changed how I track my code.

Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in your source code during software development. This means your local copy of the code is a complete version control repository.

A repository has **commits** of the project or a set of references to the commits called **heads**. All this information is stored in the same folder as the project in a sub-folder called **.git** and will mostly be hidden by default in most systems.

After doing **commits** to your code you can then do a git push to either Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket which are hosting services for version control.+

### **Getting started.**

To get started with Git, you have to download and install the tool on your local machine. Head over to [https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) and download the version that is compatible with your operating system. For Windows users, you will be using the Git Bash program. It will utilize all the same commands as Terminal. After the installation, run the command: `$ git --version`. This command will show you which version of git is installed on your system.

In order to use the terminal or git bash, familiarity with the basic command-line commands is important. Below are some of the most important commands, you will need to know to get started.
